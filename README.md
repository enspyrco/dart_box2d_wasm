# dart_box2d_wasm

*Experimenting using box2d-wasm in a Dart app.*

> Please Note: the repo is not working yet, progress notes below.

The .wasm file comes from [box2d-wasm](https://github.com/Birch-san/box2d-wasm) where I

- followed the instructions in the READMEs to build
- copied `Box2D.wasm` from <repo>/box2d-wasm/dist/umd/Box2D.wasm

## One-time setup

Run:

```sh
dart run wasm:setup
```
